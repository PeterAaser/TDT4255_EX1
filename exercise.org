* Exercise 1
  The task in this exercise is to implement a 5-stage pipelined processor for the RISCV32I instruction set.
  Typically when pipelining we want to occupy every stage, however for this exercise this is not the case, 
  greatly simplifying the architecture.

  The architecture you will design will look like the following:
   [[./pics/5stage.png]]
   
  Unlike the figure however, only one instruction will be in flight at a time.
  
  Consider the following simple program:
  
  #+begin_src asm
    .LC0:
      .globl	main
    main:
      add x2,x2,x2
      sub x3,x3,x0
      xor x11,x11,x12
  #+end_src
  
  For exercise 1 this will be rewritten as:
  
  #+begin_src asm
    .LC0:
      .globl	main
    main:
      add x2,x2,x2
      nop
      nop
      nop
      nop
      sub x3,x3,x0
      nop
      nop
      nop
      nop
      xor x11,x11,x12
      nop
      nop
      nop
      nop
  #+end_src

  Which removes any possible hazard.
  The only case where more than one instruction is in the pipeline is branches and jumps since
  jumps will be targeted at the instruction.
  This means that for the JAL and JALR instructions you can assume that the link register will
  not be used directly after a jump.
  In short, don't worry about weird corner cases that might arise from interleaving NOPs.
  
** Instruction set
   The chosen instruction set, RISCV32I, is a stripped down instruction set featuring integer 
   operations for 32 registers, and will be used for both exercises.
   This frees us from handling exceptions, syscalls and similar instructions, simplifying the 
   architecture a great deal.
   A description of each instruction is given in the instructions.org file accompanying this
   exercise.
   
** Getting started
   Your first move should be to study the 5-stage pipeline design until you get a good idea of 
   how instructions are executed.
   What sort of signals should each barrier handle? How is a jump executed? Should all signals
   be stopped at the barrier? (Answer: No, instruction and memory is synchronous read, and must
   therefore be considered part of the barrier, see figure)

   The canonical IF stage

   On an FPGA the memory read is synchronous, thus we consider the IMEM block to be part of the
   barrier.
   
   
** Getting started reading handout code
   There are quite a lot of files in the handout code, making it difficult to know where and how
   to start writing code for this assignment.
   The following files are fully implemented and should not be necessary to alter:
   + Tile.scala
     The top level file, this is the module accessible to the test runner.
   + Registers.scala
     Already implemented, contains logic for loading and reading registers from the tester, 
     as well as logic for peeking at register updates.
   + Imem.scala
     Already implemented. Features code for loading instructions
   + Dmem.scala
     Already implemented. Like the registers, features code for preloading memory and tracking state 
     updates.

   You are allowed to alter these files, but keep in mind that these files may be updated in case there
   is an error in the handout code, which might give you annoying merge conflicts.
   
   Next up, you can check out the partially implemented files.
   + Decoder.scala
     This file decodes ops and outputs control signals. In the skeleton code
     more signals than the canonical signals (memToReg, regWrite, memRead,
     memWrite, branch and jump) are decoded. You can choose to decode these
     elsewhere, or you may do it all in manner laid out. Your choice, do what
     YOU think is best
   + IF.scala
     The instruction fetch stage.
     Logic for updating the PC is missing, and instruction and PC is not forwarded
     to the barrier.
   + ID.scala
     Most of this stage is missing
   + MEM.scala
     Just needs some wiring
   + CPU.scala
     This is your toplevel file. In the schematic, notice how the writeback stage writes
     to the ID stage. This could be handled at the CPU level if you so choose (but you 
     should refrain from having much logic here, if it complicated it belongs in a module).
     Regardless, what's missing is barriers, an execute stage and wiring up the already
     existing components.
   
   What's missing?
   + Barriers
     You need to create barriers for each stage.
     Barriers hold state, although sometimes you need to bypass signals as well, as is the
     case with instruction from IF and memory read from MEM.
   + Execute stage
     This stage is missing entirely.
     You can put the ALU here, or you can put it in its own module which you use in EX.

** Getting started writing code
   After getting an overview of what is included you will probably feel a little lost on 
   how to start.
   A good start is to implement a PC that always counts 4 steps (no branching or jumps),
   then implement the IF barrier and wire them together in the CPU.scala file.

*** Testing your subcomponent
    Rather than running the full fledged test runner, you want to write smaller tests per
    component.
    For this it is typically enough to write a simple peek poke tester as per the chisel 
    docs, rather than building something complex (and ultra-janky) like the test framework
    implemented for grading.
    
    Keep in mind that you will get lots of synthesize errors for missing values, you should
    just set these to 0.U or false.B for the time being, it's an unfortunate side effect
    of adding partial implementations.

** Assembly tests
   TODO.
   Will finish either today or tomorrow (promise)
